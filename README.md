# Musehub's purpose is to compile together in one place information that musicians find interesting. There are three major components: Sheet music, composers, and genres. The sheet music area of the site is there to give musicians ideas about what to do next. There will (eventually) be many different styles of music on there with all different types of music as well (ex. choral, solo vocal, instrumental, etc.). As for the composers section, this is more for informational purposes. Maybe you're interested in a certain composer and want to know more about them, or you want to see what works they are most remembered for. The genres section is there to explain the tenets and some history about a given genre. The section also lists some of the most influential musicians or composers of that genre to listen to if you're curious about it.

As for technologies used, I used Express to make the server. I used html and a css framework for the styling. The framework I used was bootstrap because it gave me a lot of useful tools that really pushed my project over the edge, in my opinion.

Things I would like to add:
  - More sorting features on the index pages to more easily find what you are looking for. Currently it is simply in alphabetical order.
  - A search function. Currently I have a search bar in my nav section but it doesn't do anything.
  - More content in general, I don't have very many things up on the site.
  - A section for musicians to upload videos of their own pieces and add themselves to the site.
